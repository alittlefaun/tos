# Terms and Conditions
Last updated May 7, 2023

A personalized copy of my Terms and Conditions will be attached to the PayPal invoice. This is a general version for you to read. Please don't hesitate to reach out if you have any questions! Prior versions can be viewed [here](https://github.com/alittlefaun/tos/commits/main). This current iteration was shortened to comply with PayPal's 1000 character limit.

**1. Age**: You are 18 years or older.

**2. Timeline**: Commissions take ~2 months to complete after fabric arrival but a completion date is not guaranteed.

**3. Usage**: Plushies are intended for display purposes only and are not toys for children. Plushies will not stand up to use outside of intended purpose.

**4. Design**: Plushie face design is subject to client approval. I can't guarantee 100% accuracy but will use my best effort.

**5. Allergies**: Plushies are made in a home with a cat.

**6. Payment and Shipping**: Full payment for the plush commission, shipping costs, and any custom fees are due prior to shipping. Default shipping is via USPS with insurance, tracking, and optionally, signed delivery. I am not responsible for lost, damaged, or stolen packages.

**7. Client Cancellations**: If a client cancels before any progress has started, a full refund will be issued. If a client cancels but fabric has already been ordered, a partial refund less the cost of the fabric will be issued. If a client cancels the commission while their plush is in progress, a partial refund will be made at my own discretion. If a client fails to pay the remainder of the quote and/or does not respond 6 months after the plush is completed, the client forfeits half of the full payment for the plush commission and I reserve the right to find another buyer.

**8. Refunds**: If I am unable to complete your commission for any reason, I will issue you a full refund.

**9. Rights**: I may use images of the plush for advertising.
