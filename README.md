# Terms of Service
Last updated April 20, 2023

A personalized copy of my Terms of Service (TOS) will be attached to the PayPal invoice. This is a general version for you to read. Please don't hesitate to reach out if you have any questions!

#### (1) Ability to Accept Terms of Service
- You are 18 years or older and are fully able and competent to both enter into and comply with, the terms and conditions set in these Terms of Service.

#### (2) Timeline
- Commissions take approximately 2 months to complete after I have purchased and received the fabrics needed.
- I can't guarantee completion dates but will keep you up to date of the progress through my Twitter or another agreed upon means of communication. As I work in an unrelated industry, most of the progress will take place during the weekends.

#### (3) Materials
- I make plushies using primarily minky fabric and Poly-fil. I may also use faux fur, quilt batting, plastic pellets for weight, magnets, foam, cotton fabrics, armature, or other materials. 
- The plushies that I make are intended for display purposes only and are not toys for children. Parts of the plushie may be handsewn and will not stand up to use outside of its intended purpose.
- Plushies are made in a smoke-free home. I do have hermit crabs as pets but they stay in a tank and are very rarely handled.

#### (4) Design
  - Before beginning on a plush, I will let the client know what pattern I will be using for the plush. I may also ask for confirmation on fabric colors for a plush. Progress is considered "started" once fabric has been ordered and received. Once started, I may message the client for approval/ input on face embroidery sketches.
  - Delays in confirmation may extend the plush completion timeline.
  - While I will try my best to recreate your character, I can't guarantee 100% accuracy and in some cases, I may need to discuss simplifying designs with the client.
  - It is the client's responsibility when messaged about face embroidery design to let me know if there are any revisions that need to be made. Revisions after this point may alter the final price but will be discussed with the client.

#### (5) Price and Payment
- The quote for this commission is: [commission price].
- The full quote plus shipping is due upfront before starting the commission. If the commission quote is over $100, payment can be split in two separate payments such that a deposit equal to half of the quote is due before starting the commission and the remainder plus shipping is due upon completion and before shipping.
- All payments will be made through my shop (PayPal) only.

#### (6) Shipping
- Shipping and any custom fees are to be covered entirely by the client.
- My default shipping method is USPS priority mail with insurance but a client can choose a different method as long as it includes a tracking number, insurance, and is available in my area. I will take great care in the packaging however I am not responsible for lost or damaged packages. It is the client's responsibility to let me know if they would like to request a different shipping method or I will default to my preferred method.

#### (7) Refunds
- If a client must cancel before any progress has started, a full refund will be issued.
- If a client must cancel but fabric has already been ordered, a partial refund less the cost of the fabric will be issued.
- If a client must cancel the commission while their plush is in progress, a partial refund will be made at my own discretion.
- If a client fails to pay the remainder of the quote and/or does not respond 6 months after the plush is completed, the client forfeits the deposit and I reserve the right to find another buyer.

#### (8) Cancellations
- If I am unable to complete your commission for any reason, I reserve the right to cancel the commission and issue you a full refund.

#### (9) Rights
- I reserve the rights to use the plush for advertising (this includes but is not limited to uploading photos to DeviantArt, Twitter, Instagram, and Reddit).
- If the plush is surprise gift, I can delay posting pictures until the plush has arrived.
- The client can't claim to be the original maker of the plush.
